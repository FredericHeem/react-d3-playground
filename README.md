An example on how to use D3 and React to draw charts, histograms and other diagrams: [see live demo](https://fredericheem.github.io/react-d3-playground)

* a chart describing the price of an instrument.
* an histogram of the distribution of rate of return of this instrument.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

TL;DR 

    $ npm install
    $ npm start
